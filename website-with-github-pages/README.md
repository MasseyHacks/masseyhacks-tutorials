# Building a Website with GitHub Pages

## Websites on GitHub?!

Yup.

## Step 0: Prerequisites
1. You're going to need to know how to use git with GitHub. I'd recommend going through our [Git and GitHub Tutorial](git-and-github). The rest of these prerequisites is just a copy of the things you need for that workshop.
2. You're going to need a GitHub account. Register one by pressing the big green "Sign Up" on the top right. 
3. Get yourself a copy of git on your computer. You've got two choices:
	- Regular Git: Requires knowledge of the command line. If you're comfortable with a terminal, we'd definitely recommend this one. If you've got a package manager, you're welcome to get git from there.
		- [Download Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
		- [Download Git for OSX](https://code.google.com/archive/p/git-osx-installer/downloads)
		- [Download Git for Linux](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
	- GitHub Desktop: A friendly GUI version for those who don't know how to use a command line.
		- [Download GitHub Desktop for Windows/OSX](https://desktop.github.com/)
		- Linux not supported, sorry. If you're a Linux user, chances are you're downloading regular command line git right now.
