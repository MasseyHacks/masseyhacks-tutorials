**TODO:**
 - Make a live demo and post it here.

This is a beginner's guide to walk you through building your first website with free hosting on GitHub pages! <Put live demo here>

### Before you start:

 - Get yourself a GitHub profile.
 - Learn how to use Git and GitHub with [this tutorial](git-and-github).

### 1) Getting Everything Ready:

1. [Create a new repository on GitHub](https://github.com/new) for your Pages website.
  - It should be named *username*.github.io, using your username on GitHub.
  - The name must be of this form, or GitHub won't identify it as a website!

2. Create the `index.html` file. 
  - This is the file that's shown whenever someone lands on your website.
  - Every HTML file follows the same template:

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
      <head>
      </head>
      <body>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```
 - Add something to the HTML file: a body!
