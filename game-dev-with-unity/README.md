# 2D Game Developement in Unity

## Preliminary

Installation for Unity 5.3.2 can take up to an hour and requires internet connection. We should give warnings 2hrs and 1hr before the presentation begins, letting people know they should begin downloading Unity if they don't already have it.

To download Unity 5.3.2, go to [this link](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download?ref=personal) and download the installer. From there run the executable and follow the instructions for an ordinary setup. The installer requries internet connection to download things, like VS 2015 Community.
