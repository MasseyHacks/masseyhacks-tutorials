## Preliminaries for Intro to Game Dev w/ Unity Lecture

For attendees to be able to participate in the lecture, they must have Unity 5.3.2.

To download Unity 5.3.2, go to [this link](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download?ref=personal) and download the installer. From there run the executable and follow the instructions for an ordinary setup. The installer requries internet connection to download things, like VS 2015 Community.
