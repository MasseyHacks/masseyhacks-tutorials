### Installing JDK on Mac OS X

Most systems have the JDK already installed. To check, enter the command `java -version`. If the JDK isn't installed, it will display some sort of error message saying `java is not a recognized command` (different error on different systems).

To download the JDK, go to [this link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and download the version of the JDK that matches your system. Run the disk image (.dmg) file and follow the instructions for an ordinary installation.
