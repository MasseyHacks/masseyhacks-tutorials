# TODO

- Explain what the fields in step 5 of "Creating a Project" are.
- (If there's room) cover Chapter 4 of "Android Studio Essentials" (Android Studio UI Tour)
- Expand on the available widgets more and make our example app more interesting. (~40% done)
- Finish 'A More Useful App -> How do I make it functional?' section
- Estimate time for remaining sections.
- Spell-check (DIRELY NEEDED).
- Add table of contents.
- Add a list of topics covered w/ priorities.
- Peruse w/ Dylan to find potentially poor explanations and other problems.
- Make Powerpoint or some sort of visual presentation to go along.
- Rehearse.

- Dylan's suggestions
    - include logo images in no-dpi rather than xxhdpi
    - Don't use Basic Activity, use Empty activity
        - this'll require a lot of refactoring; retaking screenshots and omitting/rewording sections
    - widget fields in "making our app functional" section should be private or protected, **never** package private view.
