# Working with Git and Github

### 0) What the heck am I doing?
1. Git is a program used for maintaining and syncing code in between multiple computers for software development. Formally, it’s a Version Control System (VCS), and, if you’re going to be hacking together a program with a group, you’re going to want to learn how to use Git.
2. GitHub is, like the name suggests, a hub for Git. It’s a website that allows free cloud hosting for your code using Git, as long as you’re willing to share that code with everyone else. It’s a great tool for students who are just looking to practice programming and don’t have the money to dish out to store their code online.
3. **TL;DR**: Use Git with GitHub to code with your friends easily, or if you just want to back it up somewhere on the Internet.

### 1) Before We Start:
1. Register on GitHub. Click the green "Sign Up" button on the top right!
2. Download GitHub Desktop (GUI Wrapper) or, if you’re really cool, work with terminal (if you know what you’re doing) and install it with your favourite package manager.
