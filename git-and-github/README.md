# Working with git and GitHub

### What is git? Why does it have a Hub?

Have you ever thought about programming on a team? How will you all work on the same code without messing each other up? How will you keep the same code updated amongst everyone on the team?

Git was invented for this purpose. It's a program that controls your code, especially for working in a team. GitHub is a website (the one that you're on right now) which gives free hosting space for code projects that use git -- provided that you're okay with other people seeing your code.

If you plan to do any coding with your friends or coworkers, in the industry or just for fun, you'll probably end up using git. So it's pretty important that you learn to use it.

### Getting Ready

1. You're going to need a GitHub account. Register one by pressing the big green "Sign Up" on the top right. 
2. Get yourself a copy of git on your computer. You've got two choices:
	- Regular Git: Requires knowledge of the command line. If you're comfortable with a terminal, we'd definitely recommend this one. If you've got a package manager, you're welcome to get git from there.
		- [Download Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
		- [Download Git for OSX](https://code.google.com/archive/p/git-osx-installer/downloads)
		- [Download Git for Linux](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
	- GitHub Desktop: A friendly GUI version for those who don't know how to use a command line.
		- [Download GitHub Desktop for Windows/OSX](https://desktop.github.com/)
		- Linux not supported, sorry. If you're a Linux user, chances are you're downloading regular command line git right now.
