</p>

Welcome to our tutorials and workshops library! During MasseyHacks, we'll be hosting four workshops, each an hour long. You'll get some hands on experience working with programs that are pretty commonly used at hackathons, and you'll come out of each one with a finished end product!

You're completely free to pick and choose which workshops you'd like to attend at MasseyHacks. If you're fine with it, don't attend anything at all! If you're going to miss a tutorial or you'd like to review the things you've learned, feel free to come back to this repo and check them out.

For now, the workshops are currently under construction. You can get a sneak peek if you'd like.
