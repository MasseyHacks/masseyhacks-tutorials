###Resources for MasseyHacks && Beyond

There are many useful resources and tutorials out there for you to learn about all sorts of technologies. We have attached the links to a few of our favourites and some of our own (created by our Workshop Team, Jeffrey Zhao and Michael Ala) in this email today.

###Resource Specific to MasseyHacks         
Link to our Workshop [Page] (https://github.com/MasseyHacks/tutorials#masseyhacks-tutorials)

If you're planning to attend a workshop at MasseyHacks, please download the software required in the "Prerequisites" column of that workshop. Just click on the link and follow the instructions. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO THIS, because if you're not prepared at the start of the workshop, we won't wait for your download. For now, a lot of the repository is still under construction, but you can get a sneak peek at what we're working on, and what you'll learn later at the hackathon.

###PennApps Hacker Guide
PennApps is the first collegiate hackathon and one of the most well organized hackathons out there. Here is their comprehensive [Hacker Guide] (http://mentoring.pennapps.com/guide/) for you to learn all sorts of technologies.

###Hackathon Hackers Collection of Student Resources
Facebook group for ALL OF THE HACKERS in the world? Heck yes. Here is the [link] (https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackathonhackers/permalink/1197709056951244/) to a post in the group that has links to a bunch of free resources for students. Join the [Hackathon Hackers] (https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=163844093817909) group and its subgroups (especially [HS Hackers] (https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=163844093817909) and [Canada Hackers Eh?] (https://www.facebook.com/groups/hhcanada/)) if you want to stay updated with the hackers community after MasseyHacks!

###Microsoft DreamSpark
Microsoft's [DreamSpark] (https://www.dreamspark.com/) program provides students with a library of free software. If you would like to have access to the library before MasseyHacks happens, we recommend that you go sign yourself up ASAP as it takes some time for them to process your request!
